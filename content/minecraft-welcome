## Tips and Tricks for a Pro Server Exprince
We have some Datapacks and plugins for the server to help with the ease of life.  We mostly are using [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net) with a few other plugins.  Our aim is to add quality of life addons but nothing major or game changing.

### Timber
Make like a tree and get out of here... cut trees down faster with any ax.  Break the bottom block of a tree and have the whole tree break in just a snap!  No configuring your client or anything!

### Teleporting
Zipping around the server can save time and hassel.  Deep in a mining expidition and need food?  Telleport home grab some food then telleport back - it is that easy!  Your friend have a wicked cool build?  Tel

#### Home
Your home base is your castle and it is important to be able to find it and return home.  To set home you will want to use the following command in chat: `/trigger sethome`

Be warned that will telleport your right back to that block even if it is not air.  To return home at any time use `/trigger home`

#### Back
To go back to our last place is: `/trigger back`

This can be useful to TP between to places rapidly.

#### To Player
Want to get your friend super fast?  If you hold tab in game you will see current players with an number next to there name.  The number is the ID and is what you use to TP to a player: `/trigger tpa set NUMBER`

It will be asked if they want to have you teleported to them.  It will time out after a few second but can be seen in chat.

#### Teleporting Blogs

Stairs are so last year.  Want to teleport up and down?  Use a wool block with an ender pearl to make it a teleported.  Place anouther one teleporter block anywhere in the Y axis.  Then stand on the block and shift or jump on the block to teleport between them.
